# Rui Shao

Infrastructure engineer working on large-scale production systems. AWS (10+ regions), Kubernetes (25+ clusters, 600+ nodes). Safe deployment, traffic control, observability, cost-aware operations. AI-assisted agents for operational workflows.

## Positioning

I build platforms at the boundary of infrastructure and backend systems — automation and AI-driven analysis to make complex environments easier to operate, safer to change, and faster to recover under real production pressure.

## Core domains

- **Platform control** — deployments, releases, traffic switching, access governance across multi-cloud, multi-cluster
- **Observability** — service impact, SLO-driven views, AI-assisted on-call investigation
- **Cost & efficiency** — Spot/Reserved Instances, lifecycle policies, topology-aware optimizations
- **Distributed systems** — task execution, gRPC streaming, concurrency control, state consistency

## Signature experience

**Datavisor (Infrastructure Engineer, 2025 – present)**
- Designed change execution workflows with rollback and approval gates — deployment time 30min → 5min
- Implemented cross-cluster traffic switching and failover (canary, blue-green) — incident recovery time -80%
- Built AI-assisted on-call workflow aggregating anomalies, affected services, dependencies, logs for faster triage
- Optimized cloud costs via Spot/Reserved Instances — 20–40% compute reduction without SLO impact

**Intel (Cloud Software Development Engineer, 2022 – 2025)**
- Built distributed task execution and data-processing systems on Kubernetes — concurrency control, state consistency, failure handling
- Engineered high-throughput gRPC streaming service — pprof-driven optimization, 200ms → 50ms latency, reduced GC pressure
- Designed correctness-first scheduling and version update mechanisms with transactional boundaries and distributed coordination

## Skills

**Languages:** Python, Golang, Java, Shell, SQL  
**Infra & tools:** AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, Docker, MySQL, YugaByte, ClickHouse, Redis, Kafka, Elasticsearch, Prometheus, InfluxDB, Grafana, Loki, gRPC, Helm, Git  
**Human languages:** Chinese, English
